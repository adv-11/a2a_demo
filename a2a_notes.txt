A2A Protocol Implementation

1. Standard Endpoints
Each agent exposes a standard /run HTTP endpoint, making them interoperable.
 This is created through common/a2a_server.py

2. Agent Metadata
Each agent provides metadata in a .well-known/agent.json file, 
which follows the A2A standard for agent discovery and describes what the agent does. 

3. Agent Communication
The common/a2a_client.py implements the client side of the A2A protocol, allowing agents to call other agents:


How It All Works
1. User Input
The process starts with the user entering travel details in the Streamlit app (streamlit_app.py):

Origin
Destination
Start/End dates
Budget

2. Request Flow

The Streamlit app sends the travel request to the host agent at http://localhost:8000/run
The host agent then coordinates by calling the other agents.

Each specialized agent (flight, stay, activities) processes the request and returns results

3. Agent Processing
Each agent follows a similar pattern:

Creates a session
Constructs a prompt for the LLM (using Google's Gemini)
Processes the LLM response
Returns structured JSON data

4. Result Aggregation
The host agent aggregates results from all agents and returns a complete travel plan:

5. User Display
Finally, the Streamlit app displays the complete travel plan to the user, organized by category:

Flights
Accommodations
Activities

Key Benefits of A2A in This System

Standardization: All agents follow the same interface, making them easily interchangeable
Decoupling: Each agent can evolve independently as long as it maintains the A2A protocol
Discoverability: The .well-known/agent.json files make it easy to discover what each agent does
Extensibility: New agents could be added without changing the core architecture
Interoperability: These agents could potentially work with other systems that implement A2A

The A2A protocol effectively enables a "plug and play" approach to building AI agent systems, 
where specialized agents can be composed into more complex workflows.
